Quick Note: Upcoming Lecture
Heads up! In the next video you will install PyPDF2 (they recently updated their website)

In order to make sure your code works just like mine does in the video, I recommend you install the same version as me. To do this, make sure you type in your command line:



pip3 install PyPDF2==1.26

AND NOT

pip3 install PyPDF2 like you see in the video because this will install the latest (and a different version than I am using)


I have also attached for you the final version of the project we are going to build here. It uses the latest PyPDF2 so you can use it as a reference.


Here is the documentation for the PyPDF2 API we will be using in the next couple of videos.


If you DO want to use the latest version of PyPDF2, then here is the code difference you will see:

(minor difference but important if you want the code to work)



What you will see with version 1.26

template = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(open('super.pdf', 'rb'))
watermark = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(open('wtr.pdf', 'rb'))
output = PyPDF2.PdfFileWriter()
 
for i in range(template.getNumPages()):
  page = template.getPage(i)
  page.mergePage(watermark.getPage(0))
  output.addPage(page)
 
  with open('watermarked_output.pdf', 'wb') as file:
    output.write(file)


What you need to do with latest version:

import PyPDF2
 
template = PyPDF2.PdfReader(open('super.pdf', 'rb'))
watermark = PyPDF2.PdfReader(open('wtr.pdf', 'rb'))
output = PyPDF2.PdfWriter()
 
for i in range(len(template.pages)):
    page = template.pages[i]
    page.merge_page(watermark.pages[0])
    output.add_page(page)
 
with open('watermaked_output.pdf', 'wb') as outputFile:
    output.write(outputFile)



Happy coding
